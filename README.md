# Kafka_Mosquitto_MongoDB_Dockers
Baedung came up with an excellent follow-along guide to set up and test out an Mosquitto/Kafka/MongoDB pipeline within an all-in-one docker enviroment, https://www.baeldung.com/kafka-connect-mqtt-mongodb#2-docker-compose-file.

This is a revision of the guide to update the docker image versions and modify the container settings, propertes where necessary to make the pipeline work.
